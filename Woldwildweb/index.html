            Drosophila's compound eye, capable of 360-degree viewing and rapid image processing, provides insights into the visual mechanisms of more complex organisms and how visual information guides behavior. Inspired by this, we've developed UAV camera systems that mimic these biological structures, enabling comprehensive, real-time surveillance. This innovative technology has not only pushed the boundaries of traditional surveillance but has completely redefined what modern monitoring can achieve.

        The compound eye of Drosophila consists of about 750 small eyes, each containing eight photoreceptor neurons, and each small eye is an independent visual unit. Because these small eye pillars cover the entire surface of the eye and face in different directions, they can capture light from almost any direction. The spherical layout of the compound eye allows Drosophila to observe almost its entire surroundings, achieving a near 360-degree field of view.

        Modeled after the structure of the fruit fly's compound eye, the drone can be fitted with multiple small cameras that are arranged in a spherical or hemispherical arrangement, facing in different directions. This layout allows the drone to cover an almost 360-degree field of view and observe its surroundings without having to turn the body.

        Each pinna contains eight photoreceptor neurons, and each pinna is a separate visual unit. Each ocellar column contains its own lens, pigment cells, and a set of photoreceptor cells. In our experiments, for Drosophila, we were able to use relatively low-power infrared illumination (propagated through its intact head) and still obtain high signal-to-noise DPP imaging at high frame rates (>100 fps).

        Fast image processing is crucial for UAV applications. Drawing on the structure and function of the compound eye of the fruit fly, we can design a UAV camera system that can rapidly process large amounts of visual data. Such a system can greatly enhance the performance of UAVs in a variety of application scenarios, where images captured by each camera can be processed in parallel under 360-degree dead-angle surveillance, thus dramatically reducing data processing time.

        All fruit flies have an optic rod in each eyelet. This is basically how insects "see". Light passes through the lens and focuses on the optic rod, stimulating the photoreceptor pigments. In most insect eyes, each pinna is like a "pixel" that the insect can see. Although it is not actually a "pixel", for simplicity's sake it is a good analogy. The fruit fly's optic rod is divided into seven parts. It's a fairly complex system, but basically Drosophila can increase its resolution by a factor of 7 without increasing the size of its eyes. They have high visual acuity and are particularly sensitive to fast-moving objects, even if they are very small in size. This characteristic allows the insects to react quickly to threats or opportunities from different directions.

        Drawing on this biological mechanism, a drone camera could be designed to contain multiple independent receiving units, each capable of segmenting and processing incoming light like a fruit fly's optical rod. Such a design would not only increase the overall resolution of the camera, but also enhance its ability to capture and analyze high-speed moving objects. For example, drones can more accurately capture details of rapidly changing scenes when performing urban surveillance or nature observation, thus providing higher quality data to support decision-making and response.
